# Onions, Jalapenos, Cilantro Calculator

The OJC Calculator is a tool that combats inaccurate prepping by providing recipe dependent calculations of onions, jalapenos, and cilantro that can be used at any and all Chipotle locations.

# About the Project
The OJC Calculator is a passion project I created while working at Chipotle Mexican Grill. 

Each morning we are tasked with dicing fresh onions, jalapenos, and cilantro to add into our rices, salsas, and guacamole. I found that we often had diced more onions, jalapenos, and cilantro than needed. As a result of overprepping, there was an unnecessary increase in food waste and decrease in morning productivity. The culprit of our wastefulness was the calculations being generated by our current prep tools.

The previous system we used to calculate OJC needs relied on two factors: 1) your restaurant has nearly perfect inventory and usage counts and 2) you are opening with no held-overnight prep items. These scenarios are certainly _not impossible_ but are an exception rather than the rule. So why is this the way in which each restaurant's numbers are being generated? Why are the OJC needs different across stores even when they are prepping identical amounts of salsa, rice, or guacamole? Thus the idea of the OJC Calculator was born! 

Rather than relying on the restaurant dependent factors our previous system used, the OJC Calculator combats inaccurate prepping by basing its calculations on the universal Chipotle recipes. The OJC Calculator can be used at any and all Chipotle locations.
 
 # Challenges
 * Gathering Data & Creating a Standard Equation
      * I needed to figure out a way to convert the recipes from cups of OJC to oz of OJC
      * It was necessary to test and find a sweet-spot average weight (in ounces) for each cup of OJC. The trick here was to find an average weight that would never cause us to underprep, but at worst case scenario, cause a very slight overprep. 
      * After many trial runs, I got my numbers and converted our recipes from cups to oz.
      * I then turned each recipe into an equation that factored in the needs of salsas, guac, and rices to calculate the OJC usage directly.
      
 * Designing a GUI
     * I spent a lot of time figuring out a design that would be aesthetically pleasing while also optimally organizing the information it provided.
